http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?artist=1%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,group_concat(uname,%27-%27,pass,%27-%27,email),10,11%20from%20users--

that means we have a system vulnerability for SQL injection. 


Solution: 
change the artist query in code to:                 -->

String name_query = "GET aname FROM artists WHERE id="+@artist_id;
String desc_query = "GET adesc FROM artists WHERE id="+@artist_id;

using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlCommand(connectionString)){

	SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(name_query,conection);
	SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(desc_query,conection);
	command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", artist_id);
	connection.Open();
	command.ExecuteNonQuery();
	
}
